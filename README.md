# Devcon London | Code of Conduct

## Community

Devcon London is a network of trusted professionals working in digital productions keen on discussing the topics we all love.

Your voice is always welcome. It's natural to feel intimidated when posting to a group of peers as large as Devcon London. Even if you’re lurking, your presence is appreciated!

## Origin

The [Devcon.network](https://devcon.network) mailing list was originally created in London in 2015 to meet and build a professional network of trusted people. Over time the community was grown and evolved to became a resource for technical knowledge and job/gig listings. 

## Rules

1. **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:
    - Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
    - Threats of violence
    - Deliberate intimidation
    - Sexually explicit or violent material that is not contextualized and preceded by a considerate warning
    - Unwelcome sexual attention
    - Stalking or following
    - Any other kind of harassment
2. **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
3. **Be encouraging.** Share your knowledge. Prop up those who need support. Go out of your way to support and mentor those who are unseen or unheard.
4. **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community. Be mindful of sarcasm and snark that detract from or derail the conversation in a negative way. Trolling and personal attacks are forbidden.
5. **Be exemplary and remember the person**. When you communicate to other people on this list, you must ask yourself “Would I say this to the person's face in front of a group of my respected peers, mentors, teachers, and students?”
6. **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.
7. **Keep it on-topic.** Consider if what you say serves the intent of the original post. If not, create a new thread.
8. **Speak up.** If you see bad behavior, please call it out and contact one of the moderators.
9. **Be a professional.** Your work must be at the highest level you can achieve: since you're likely to get some work through our channels if you want to, using the name of our community reflects on all our members. Make sure it is well spent so that we can keep receiving good job opportunities.

## Moderation

Should you experience anything that violates this code, or makes you feel unwelcome on the list, please contact one of the moderators. Our community takes these violations seriously and the offenders could be banned.

## Adding New Members

Devcon.network is always growing! Only existing members can invite new members by the following procedure:

1. Direct them to [devcon.network](https://devcon.network)
2. Wait until the new member notifies you that they have filled in the form in the website.
3. Post a courteous, professional, and supportive welcome message to the Slack channel to give the new member visibility.
